                    <p className='story'> We, Ira Mascardo, Jennifer Tran, and Rafael Loredo, are a group of coding enthusiasts. We all met as coworkers in Plano, Texas at a reputable tech company. Every week,
                        we often met up and explore the city. With the city's limitness offerings of restaurants, and activities,
                        we found it hard to find online resources to quickly find the city hotspots. TexasTourin came to fruition to help
                        fellow adventurers navigate the city and fall in love with the LoneStar state.
